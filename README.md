### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**gnnlab/gnnlab** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Welcome to gnnlab.

Howdy :) I'm "Edward.Hwang" who manages gnnlab.
gnnlab represents a gemological neural network.

I belong to the "GIA Alumni Association #Korea Chapter" and
CTO of the "Korea Gem Information Center" in Korea.

Also, I am currently doing PhD at "Seoul National University of Science and Technology"

I am very interested in jewelry and AI.VR.ML, so trying to converge jewelry and IT.
Thank you for your interest and help.

More details will be posted in 2022... maybe :)

Thank you for attention.
