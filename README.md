# "A Study on the Cognitive Intelligence Gem Discrimination System"

The identification and appraisal of gems is a method for classifying gems and deriving authenticity and correct results.

In general, using a jewelry loupe, a microscope, etc., it is carried out based on various features observed with the human eye in a situation magnified by 10 magnify or more.

In addition, ancillary analysis techniques such as optical and physical inspection can be applied together depending on the type or characteristics of gemstones, and usually only ‚Äúprofessionals who have received professional training for jewelry‚Äù perform this.

Due to this particularity, retailers, dealers, or consumers who do not have professional knowledge have suffered damage by purchasing low-quality jewelry or gem at a high price or purchasing separate jewelry that is similar only in color.

Therefore, in this study, we study how to build a cognitive intelligent gem identification system based on stereotyped big data and to identify gems more easily and accurately.
