Welcome to gnnlab.


Howdy :) I'm "Edward.Hwang" who manages gnnlab.

Gnnlab represents a gemological neural network.


I belong to the "GIA Alumni Association #Korea Chapter" and CTO of the "Korea Gem Information Center" in Korea.

Also, I am currently doing PhD at "Seoul National University of Science and Technology"


I am very interested in jewelry and AI.VR.ML, so trying to converge jewelry and IT.

Thank you for your interest and help.

More details will be posted in 2022... maybe :)


Thank you for attention. ðŸ˜„
